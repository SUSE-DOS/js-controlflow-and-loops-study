## Questions

1. Will the `alert` message be shown?

   **Example:**

   ```js
   if (42) {
     alert("üëã Hi!");
   }
   ```

   **Answer:**

   ```
   The condition will be true so the alert code will run.
   ```

1. Will this loop ever stop? And is it a good idea?

   ** Example:**

   ```js
   while (true) {
     console.log("It goes on and on...");
   }
   ```

   **Answer:**

   ```
   There is no break statement so the console will keep looping. This is not good practice as the software will eventually crash.
   ```
